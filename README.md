# Torunament Tracker

## DESCRIPTION

This is a tournament tracking application, to determine who is the best at playing a basketball game.
The idea is to create a bracket tournament system where the computer will tell them who to play in a single-elimination style bracket.
At the end, the winner should be identified. Their model is the NCAA Basketball tournament bracket for March Maddness.

## PLANNING STEP 1

1. Tracks games played and ther outcome (who won).
2. Multiple competitors play the tournament.
3. Creates a tournament plan (who plays in what order).
4. Schedules games.
5. A single loss eliminates a player from the tournament.
6. The last player standing is the winner.

### QUESTIONS

1. How many players will the tournament handle? Is it variable?
2. If a tournament has less than the full complement of players, how do we handle it?
3. Should the ordering of who plays each other be random or ordered by input order?
4. Should we schedule the game or are they just played whenever?
5. If the games are scheduled, how does the system know when to schedule games for?
6. If the games are played whenever, can a game from the second round be played before the first round is complete?
7. Does the system need to store a score of some kind or just who won?
8. What type of front-end should this system have (Winform, webpage, mobile app, etc.)?
9. Where will the data be stored?
10. Will this system handle entry fees, prizes, or other payouts?
11. What type of reporting is needed?
12. Who can fill in the results of a game?
13. Are there varying levels of access?
14. Should this system contact users about upcoming games?
15. Is each player on their own or can teams use this tournament tracker?
